title: Financial Victory? An analysis of NFL wins from contract data.
---

I've always been a Green Bay Packers fan, which may be a bit surprising given that I'm currently in Chicago as a part of the fall cohort of the Metis Data Science Bootcamp. But I am a Cheesehead born and raised. My family may not agree on everything, but we can agree when it comes to our NFL fandom. 

Why look at contract data? My initial interest in this question comes from looking at the quarterback position. Since the 2010 season, the Super Bowl winning quarterbacks were Aaron Rodgers, Eli Manning, Joe Flacco, Russell Wilson, Tom Brady (three times), Peyton Manning, and Nick Foles. Of these, Joe Flacco and Russell Wilson were on their rookie contracts, while Nick Foles was a backup for a starter on a rookie contract. 
 
I found this situation interesting. Considering also runners up in the Super Bowl, three additional quarterbacks on a rookie contract also appear. Furthermore, the 2018 NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes is still on his rookie contract. These contracts are notably cheaper than contracts given to the same players in future contracts. 

This motivates my analysis. Does having additional cap space to spend on other position groups help a team win? More generally, what can linear regression say from spending patterns in relation to regular season wins?
